# haskalgs

This repository has/will have implementations of various algorithms which range from basic to advanced and all are implemented in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Obviously, most, if not all, algorithms use/will use recursion.

---

_One of the primary goals of the repository is to have minimal, yet complete, implementations of algorithms._

## Current implementations
_Searching algorithms_
* [Binary search](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/search/BinarySearch.hs)
* [Exponential search](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/search/ExponentialSearch.hs)
* [Interpolation search](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/search/InterpolationSearch.hs)
* [Linear search](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/search/LinearSearch.hs)

_Sorting algorithms_
* [Bubble sort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/BubbleSort.hs)
* [Merge sort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/MergeSort.hs)
* [Quicksort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/Quicksort.hs)
* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/SelectionSort.hs)


It should be noted that current algorithms do not have accompanying [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) tests which are the must!  
I will try to update the list and add the tests as I have time.
