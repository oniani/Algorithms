# Purity

This repository has the implementations of various algorithms and data structures for the everyday use. Everything is implemented in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). Obviously, most, if not all, algorithms and data structures use recursion in some way. The primary goal of the repository is to have a collection of high-performance and, preferably, minimal implementations algorithms and data structures.

### Why Haskell?
Haskell allows us to embrace the beautiful ideas of function reusability and complexity management. In other words, functions
can be treated as variables which opens up a whole new world of algorithms and data structures. By treating the functions as the first class citizens, Haskell evangelizes the idea of breaking down a problem into simple steps and dealing with the smaller subproblems making the problem-solving a lot more efficient. Besides, its lazy evaluation makes the algorithms extremely fast by not computing the values which are not going to be used.
