# haskalgs

This repository has/will have implementations of various algorithms which range from basic to advanced and all are implemented in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

> One of the primary goals of the repository is to have minimal, yet complete, implementations of algorithms.

## Current implementations

_Searching algorithms_
* [Binary search](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/search/BinarySearch.hs)

_Sorting algorithms_
* [Bubble sort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/BubbleSort.hs)
* [Merge sort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/MergeSort.hs)
* [Quicksort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/Quicksort.hs)
* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/oniani/haskalgs/blob/master/src/sort/SelectionSort.hs)

It should also be noted that current algorithms do not have accompanying [QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) tests which are the must!

I will try to update the list and add the tests as I have time.
